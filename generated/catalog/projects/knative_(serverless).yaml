  description: 'Knative is a developer-focused serverless application layer which
    is a great complement to the existing Kubernetes application constructs.
    Knative consists of three components: an HTTP-triggered autoscaling
    container runtime called “Knative Serving”, a CloudEvents-over-HTTP
    asynchronous routing layer called “Knative Eventing”, and a
    developer-focused function framework which leverages the Serving and
    Eventing components, called "Knative Functions".'
